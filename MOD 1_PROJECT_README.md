MODULE 1 FINAL PROJECT – THE FLATIRON SCHOOL


DESCRIPTION
-----------

For our Module 1 final project, we built a CLI application that incorporates a wine API and integrates a database of wine and user information. This application allows a user to access a database of wine information to search for specific wines, write a review for a chosen wine, get a recommendation for a wine, or access previously written wine reviews to either update these reviews or delete them.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

In a new terminal session:

1.	Run bundle install to install the Ruby gems required for the application

2.	Run the lib/run.rb file from the terminal to start the application

3.	Go through prompts as desired

Please note a “no” response to any prompt that requires a “no” will exit the user from the application
